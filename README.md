==========================================================

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stefanv/imagexd_scientific_python/master?filepath=index.ipynb)

1.	[Follow the preparation instructions](preparation.md)
2.	Start the notebook server *from the same directory as this README* with `jupyter notebook`

**Objectives:**

a) a brief overview of scikit-image and related packages in the scientific Python ecosystem, including how to create your environment;

b) filtering, segmentation and data extraction of large 2D and 3D images;

c) exploration and visualization of large 2D and 3D images;

d) inspection, counting, and measuring attributes of objects; routines that extract shape, color and texture features; how to use topological description to calculate equidistant boundaries;

e) data reduction algorithms using priors from image acquisition instruments and/or sample architecture;

f) parallel data processing pipelines for accelerating image analysis.
