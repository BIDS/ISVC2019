Objectives: 
a) a brief overview of scikit-image and related packages in the scientific Python ecosystem; 
b) exploration and visualization of large 2D and 3D images, including filters and segmentation; 
c) inspection, counting, and measuring attributes of objects; routines that extract shape, color and texture features; how to use topological description to calculate equidistant boundaries; 
d) data reduction algorithms using priors from image acquisition instruments and/or sample architecture; 
e) parallel data processing pipelines for accelerating image analysis.
